Canada is a great big, beautiful country with lots to see and do. In 2017, Canada's 150th year of Confederation, we had approximately 20.8 million visitors, breaking our previous record.

It's no surprise then that two of the top five most popular services on Canada.ca are "Get a visitor visa" and "Get an electronic travel authorization (eTA)". Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) issues both of these travel documents are issued by.

Knowing which document you need to apply for, if any, isn’t always clear. Many people were having a hard time determining which one they needed. Some people could not board their flight to Canada because they had for the wrong document.

In January 2017, the IRCC Web team made it a priority to fix this task before a change to the eTA requirements came into effect in May which would have added to the confusion. To help out, the Digital Transformation Office worked with IRCC to improve people’s experience in figuring out what documents they need when visiting Canada. Here’s how this optimization project turned out.

<h3>Understanding the problem</h3>
During our discovery research, we mapped out the different scenarios for people visiting Canada. What they need depended on a variety of criteria: 
<ul>
      <li>what country they are coming from</li>
      <li>what foreign citizenship they currently hold</li>
      <li>whether they are a dual citizen or a permanent resident</li>
      <li>what mode of travel they are using to cross the Canadian border</li>
</ul>

We then narrowed our scope to the most common tasks based on IRCC’s data and knowledge:

<br>Find out what I need to come to Canada...
<ul>
      <li>... as a tourist from my country</li>
      <li>... to visit my children or grandchildren</li>
      <li>... as a Canadian permanent resident</li>
      <li>... as a former Canadian permanent resident</li>
      <li>... as a Canadian dual citizen</li>
      <li>... from the USA with an American passport</li>
      <li>... to transit through a Canadian airport</li>
</ul>

We ran hundreds of people through these tasks in a combination of online and moderated studies to find out how and why they were struggling.

This is what the key page in the process looked like when we started. Notice the text at the top of the page with links for exceptions, dual citizens, and Canadian permanent residents. Testing showed that people weren't able to consistently see these links and would go straight to the drop-down list.

 </span>
 </div>

<h3>Redesigning the process</h3>
With baseline research in hand, the team redesigned the process to solve the issues we learned about. Together, IRCC and DTO built prototypes that we hoped would improve the experience of people trying to understand which travel documents they needed. Key fixes included: 
<ul>
      <li>using a question and answer approach to guide people through the task</li>
      <li>creating new pages for groups that were not covered previously (refugees and former permanent residents)</li>
      <li>simplifying navigation to reduce cognitive load, by removing sidebar navigation links from pages</li>
      <li>reducing the number of links on the Visit Canada topic page from 9 to 5 to streamline the target path</li>
      <li>adding a crosslink to the Visit Canada topic page in the Travel theme menu based on user evidence</li>
</ul>

<div itemprop="text" class="" data="type-text">
      <div class="img-responsive center-block col-md-6">
          <span class=""><img src="../images/eTA-AVE/VisaETA-after.jpg" alt="Image showing what the Find out if you need a visa or an eTA page looked like after optimization" border="5">
 </span>
 </div>

The layout was at times confusing, including links to rules and requirements. We replaced it by a series of questions and answers that help people get to the right answer.

<h3>Validating the prototypes</h3>

To understand if the prototypes were working better for people trying to visit Canada, we ran 46 participants through the tasks in café testing sessions. The overall success rate for the prototypes was 91%, representing an improvement of 44 percentage points against the same tasks on the live site. 

<h3>Seeing it work in the real world</h3>

Once the prototypes were integrated into the live site in March 2017, analytics showed a solid improvement in people making it from the Visit Canada topic page through to the apply pages. 


<b>Before and after optimization:</b> February 2017 and June 2017
<div itemprop="text" class="" data="type-text">
      <div class="img-responsive center-block col-md-6">
          <span class=""><img src="../images/eTA-AVE/VisaETA-funnels2.JPG" alt="Image showing that in February 2017, only 35% of clicks from the Visit Canada topic page went to either the Find out if you need a visa or an eTA, Apply for a visa, or Apply for an eTA pages. In June 2017 that number rose to 62%. This indicates that the Visit Canada topic page became more effective at helping people complete their tasks." border="5">
 </span>
 </div>
      
As the chart shows, people’s success at finding the apply pages jumped by 27 percentage points, from 35% before to 62% after. Also, we saw more people using the navigation menu to enter the flow. Due to this project, people who want to visit Canada can spend less time worrying about travel documents, and more time enjoying their visit to our country.
