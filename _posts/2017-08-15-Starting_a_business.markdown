“Starting a business” is a top task for Canadians and it’s not an easy one. There are varying provincial and federal legal requirements depending on the size and type of business. Together with Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED) and the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), the Digital Transformation Office at TBS set out to improve the experience for Canadians starting a business via Canada.ca. 

## The optimization process

The process we used for this project had multiple steps. We started by exploring the user’s journey to fulfill the various government requirements. We then turned what we saw in that journey into tasks. The tasks are what formed the base for a usability study with Canadians on the Canada.ca site. 

The results from the usability test provided us 2 important elements, a baseline to measure against later and ideas on what should be examined to improve task success. We then held a series of design sprints, testing different design prototypes as we went. Finally, we then measured improvements against the baseline data collected during the first usability tests.

## How we knew it worked

The new designs went live in the Canada.ca “Business” menu in March 2017, but we didn’t stop there. After a few months, we measured the impact on the flow of web visitors. One of the big changes made was to bring the important step of “Choosing a business name” up a level. We placed it onto the “Starting a business” page, and streamlined the route to the search page for business names. 


**Before and after optimization:** February 4 to April 4, 2017 and May 26 to July 24, 2017

As you can see above, the flow is like a funnel leading to successful outcomes at the bottom of the image. In the first image on the left, only 10 people made it from the “Starting a business” page to the “Choosing a business name” page in the 2 month period measured before the optimization. The image on the right shows what happened 2 months later. 491 people took the new simplified path to the search page for business names. That’s 55 times more people who found the task!

<!-- Long description for image: This chart displays the steps for the Choosing a business name task. It shows how many users made it through to each step before and after the optimization project. Before optimization 100% of users (3,480) made it to the page ‘Business registration and incorporation’. After that only 15% of users (52) made it to the ‘Naming your business’ page. From there 4% of users (135) made it to the ‘NUANS corporate name search’. 1% (23 users) made it to the ‘Learn more’ section and only 10 users made it to ‘Order now’. After optimization 100% of users (3081) made it to the page ‘Choosing a business name’. 59% of users (1818) then made it to the page ‘Find out if the name is taken’. After that 16% of users (491) made it to the ‘Search Canadian corporate names’ page. --> 

## Discovering where to start optimizing

Unfortunately, starting a business is complex. An entrepreneur has to know where to start, and they have to understand the sequence and implications of their decisions. Building this understanding is further complicated by the different priorities of government agencies. For example: 

- Corporations Canada is interested in helping people who want to incorporate federally
- the Canada Revenue Agency wants to make sure business get business numbers, GST and corporate tax accounts
- the provinces have their own incorporation and permit processes 

While the existing web pages did serve those needs, the team specifically focused on the needs of people starting a business in Canada.

The needs of the entrepreneurs were straightforward. They wanted to:

- deal with one government requirement at a time, in the right order, feeling secure that nothing was missed
- understand which steps they have already done and which are relevant and required of them
- only read what applies to them, instead of everything, and are easily able to get to the specific application they needed

To make sure those needs would get met, we mapped out the different decisions that a new business owner would have to make. We also mapped out the sequence they would have to take when starting a business. As we explored, we noticed that one of the first things a user had to do was choose a business name. They had to do this before taking almost any of the other government registration steps.  

Research also highlighted some of the decisions and sequences that were particular pain points for people. Here’s an example of a decision map for one of the start a business business tasks. It helped us to see where the pain points for the entrepreneur appear.

<!-- Long description of image: This process map explains the decisions a person must make when deciding whether to incorporate a business. If they decide that they are going to incorporate they must decide whether to get a unique business name or use their own name. If they are incorporating federally they must decide whether they want a federal or provincial name report. They can then apply. If they decide they don’t want to incorporate, they must decide if they will be a sole proprietor and use their own name. If they decide to be a sole proprietor they must then get a business number. If they decide not to be a sole proprietor then they must choose a unique name. This also applies if they decide to become a partnership or corporation.  -->

The map also helped us design a series of steps to meet the needs of the entrepreneurs. Designing the steps sometimes involved pruning options that were displayed prominently on the existing pages. Steps had to be stand-alone and clearly differentiated from other steps. To that end, we removed the many links to guides, business plans and checklists. Instead the first step was a single link to “Planning a business”.

In contrast, choosing a business name surfaced as a crucial step. Yet there was no link to it at all on the “Start a business” topic page. That made it very hard for our research participants to find it unless they dove into registration pages. Unfortunately, only 37% of our 20 baseline test participants (students studying business) were able to find the business name search. The success rate was low, but it gave us lots of room to improve.

## Usability testing to evaluate the designs

Once all the various pieces of the new design came together, we launched another research study to test usability on the prototypes. We did the study with a similar set of business students. Success at the “Find out if a name is taken” task rose from 37% to 94% in our task-based usability study.

This testing gave us the confidence to know that we were on the right track. Based on the improvements we were seeing, we were able to launch the new design on Canada.ca.
