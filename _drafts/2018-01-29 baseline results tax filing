The Digital Transformation Office is currently engaged in an optimization project with the Canada Revenue Agency. This time, we are looking at tasks related to filing payroll and GST/HST. To start, we used the prototype from the Starting a Business project, then tested new tasks and improved it further.

## Baseline Test Results - What tasks did we test?

For this project, we wanted to focus in on issues that people were actually facing. To do this, we invited agents from CRA's call centres to help craft the task scenarios. Some of these people actually answer phones when people call CRA with their questions. 

Test participants were asked to complete all 10 tasks, with 5 minutes per task. The questions were as follows, although the order changed for each participant. 

Q1. 
Can you pay your company's payroll CPP and EI deductions to CRA using Interac?

Q2.
You issued an invoice for services, with GST included, the day before you filed your return. Can you wait until the invoice is paid before sending in your payment?

Q3.
You accidentally made an error when you submitted your last payroll return. You under-paid your source deductions by $350. Will you be fined?

Q4.
If your Ontario company sells and ships a taxable product to a customer in Alberta, do you charge them GST, PST or both (i.e. HST)?

Q5.
You mailed a cheque to pay your company’s payroll deductions. How would you confirm that the CRA received it?

Q6.
You registered for GST for the first time in on August 31, and will file your return annually. Your fiscal year ended October 31. In that time, your net tax was $2,500. Will you need to pay your GST in instalments for the next fiscal year?

Q7. 
A business collects taxes from its employees’ pay. It sends the taxes it has collected to the government 4 times a year. When must it send the next payment by?

Q8.
In 2018, what will be the maximum amount of CPP contributions for one employee for the whole year?

Q9.
You have recently registered for a GST account and have been collecting GST. How would you find out when you have to pay it?

Q10.
Your business operates seasonally, so you don't pay employees during the winter. Do you need to let CRA know this?



## Baseline Test Results - How successful were people at completing their tasks?


The following chart compares the baseline test scores for findability with the task completion score for all eleven questions posed to participants.

## Common issues for mobile users

Many people didn’t find Health in the ‘hamburger’menu on the mobile home page of Canada.ca – so if their search failed, they tended to fail the task.

       </span>
      </div>

<p><br>

Recommendation: make the menu items as visible in the mobile view as they are in the desktop view.

## Writing meaninful titles and descriptions

One of the hard things about writing tasks is tayloring your word choice to a non-specialist audience. To increase the findability of your content it is important to encorporate commonly used search terms into your section titles and web content instead of focusing on using scientific lingo or profession-specific jargon. 

Our UX study demonstrated that users often overlooked a link that would have taken them to the correct information because they didn't recognize the title of that link or section as being useful for completing their task. In the example below, we see that people misunderstood this list – most answered incorrectly that they should get the Yellow Fever vaccine to visit Mexico.  Only a few opened it to see that it is not recommended for Mexico.

   <div class="img-responsive left-block col-md-6">
          <span class=""><img src="../images/Use-Vaccine-recommendations-hidden 2.JPG" alt="image-of-mobile-device-where-the-vaccine-recommendations-hidden-in-drop-down-menu">
  </span>
            </div>
 </p>
<div class="img-responsive right-block col-md-6">
          <span class=""><img src="../images/New-Vaccines-titles_iphonesespacegrey_portrait.png" alt="image-of-mobile-device-where-the-vaccine-recommendations-are-visoble-in-drop-down-menu">
 </span>
      </div>
</p>
<p><br>
Recommendation: change list titles so that recommendations are visible on first glance.

## Displaying information meaningfully 

Half of the people incorrectly answered that a cough was one of the most important signals that someone had the flu rather than a cold. In this case, they missed two of the three bullets that listed the most common flu symptoms. For this scenario, the participants that successfully completed the task were those that found the flu vs. cold table which was located further down the page. The task highlights that how information is displayed can have a significant impact on task completion. Although the information they needed was at the top of the page in bulleted form, it was only those that saw the table comparing the symptoms of flus versus colds that were able to complete their task successfully.

The image below shows an example of the what the users saw on their mobile devices that resulted in them choosing the incorrect answer to their task. Many users saw this information and failed to scroll further down the page to find the chart.

 <div itemprop="text" class="" data="type-text">
      <div class="img-responsive center-block col-md-6">
          <span class=""><img src="../images/Understand.jpg" alt="image-of-mobile-device-where-the-user-misunderstands-given-information">

       </span>
       <div>
        
<p><br>
Recommendation: add the table of flu versus cold symptoms to the top of this page – people who found it got the answer correct.
