The diseases and immunization optimization project kicked off in the fall of 2017. Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada pulled together a collaborative team from web communications, immunization and disease programs, and strategic marketing. Combined with the designers and researchers from the Digital Transformation Office, we set out to improve content and design related to diseases, immunization, and travel health. 

## Discovery

We started with a discovery phase. This is taking time to understand the current situation, people's needs related to the current content, and problems they may be having. Sources included reviewing previous usability studies, analyzing website traffic patterns and search behaviours, and reviewing phone and support requests. This provided enough insight to determine target audiences, which we then used to talk to people affected by the current content. We also researched vaccine hesitancy and how that's been addressed around the world. 

We also found that most people were accessing the content using mobile devices. People were checking whether they had the cold or the flu, when they needed vaccinations, or which vaccinations they would need for a specific country on their smartphones.  

From these discovery insights, the team generated a set of job stories. Job stories are real-world scenarios that reflect what people are actually trying to do. They follow a structure like: <strong>When I</strong> &hellip; (the situation), <strong>I want to</strong> &hellip; (the motivation), <strong>so I can</strong> &hellip; (the expected outcome). For example:

* **When** it's flu season, **I want to** know if/where the flu shot is available, **so I can** go and get it
* **When** I'm thinking about immunizing my child, **I want to** know if the vaccine is safe, **so I can** understand the risks
* **When** I return from a tropical trip, **I want to** know if I can be tested for Zika, **so I can** decide if I should delay getting pregnant

</figure><br>

From the long list of job stories, the team voted to narrow down to the top 11 stories. We crafted these stories into task scenarios that could be used to test the website with people in our target audiences. 

## Establishing a baseline 

Before making changes, we need to establish a baseline score. This gives us a measure we can use to tell if our changes are truly improving things. It also helps us to prioritize areas that are most in need of improvement. We use moderated usability tests to determine this baseline, so we also gain a lot of insight into how people use the current site and the problems they face. 

We recruited 16 employed parents of children under 18. These participants attended research sessions in Toronto and Ottawa with their smartphones in English or French. Participants were asked to complete the 11 task scenarios on the Canada.ca website. If they had time, they repeated one task on the Ontario.ca site for comparison. 

The task scenarios were presented in random order, except for the first and last tasks. Some tasks began on the home page of Canada.ca while others began on the Zika, Flu and immunization pages. The scenarios were presented on a tablet beside the participant. The participant could refer to the tablet while they attempted the task, and then return to enter in their answer and proceed to the next. 
 
The 3 important measures for optimization studies are:
* Findability success rate: whether people found the page designed as the target for that task
* Task completion success rate: whether people successfully selected the correct answer to the task scenario
* Time on task: how long it took to complete the task (only measured if the task had at least a 75% task completion success rate)

For the baseline test, the overall findability rate was 66%, and the overall success rate was 54% across the 11 tasks and 176 task trials. 

We watched videos of the testing sessions together. This helped the entire team understand the problems people had in trying to complete the tasks. We could observe and quantify behaviours and usability issues that caused task failures. We captured these observations in click paths (to understand how people moved throught the site) and described the problems in detailed issues so we could address them during the design phase.  

## Redesign to improve task success

To solve the long list of issues we captured, the team created a working prototype for a new design on the Github code-sharing site. We held several workshops with smaller teams to work intensively on issues that participants experienced. For example, the Zika team realized that participants hadn't absorbed the serious risks of pregnancy after exposure to Zika. The immunization team worked hard to integrate content to counter vaccine hesitancy. And new home page designs for Canada.ca were created to expose the links to Health and Travel that people missed in the baseline tests. 

Throughout the design process, we tested content with people through small, informal "guerilla" tests. These tests revealed problems with our designs that we were able to address before full-scale moderated usability testing.

<p>
Two smartphones are shown with 2 different web pages. One is labelled "Baseline", the other "Redesign". In the "Baseline" page, the title is "Countries with recent or ongoing risk of Zika virus infection", followed by 2 long paragraphs of text that are too small to read. Following that is a list of countries beginning with "A", starting with Angola, Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, and Aruba. An arrow points to the country list with an annotation "Too small to touch. Click to see answer.".</p>
<p>
In the "Redesign" page, the title is "Zika cirus: Destinations with risk of Zika". Below is a list of 6 links that are too small to read, one of which is highlighted. An arrow points to the highlighted link with the annotation "Tasks grouped together. Simplified title".</p>
<p>
Below that is a short paragraph of text too small to read, followed by a search box and a table showing countries with "No risk of Zika", "Low risk of Zika" or "High risk of Zika" next to them. An arrow points to the countries with an annotation "All countries listed. Answers in view."

## Measuring success rates on the redesigned prototype

Once the revised design was ready, 16 new participants were recruited to complete the same 11 tasks. We aim for either 80% success, or an improvement of at least 20 points over the baseline score. The revised content and design improved findability rates from 66% up to 90%. Overall task completion success rose from 54% to 84%.   
 
 This chart shows the task completion success rates across the baseline and redesigned validation test on the prototype for the 32 participants:

       </span>
	   <strong>NOTE that we have to include a datatable listing all of these values, it's not enough to say that it's a chart</strong>

 ## Key drivers of success 
 
 The team derived this set of 6 design principles that appeared to have the most impact on improving success rates: 
 
* Design for mobile first: less prose, more space and interaction

* Group tasks and sub-tasks together to improve findability: reduce layers

* Design content to flow from specific to general:  use calls to action

* Lose the paper mentality: bring content onto web pages and out of PDFs and posters

* Bring top tasks up: don’t dilute content with tiny tasks 

* Show answers not information: craft answers for top tasks
