In the fall of 2017, the Diseases and Immunization optimization project kicked off by pulling together a collaborative team with Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada. Our team included people from web communications, immunization and disease programs, and strategic marketing, along with the designers and researchers from the Digital Transformation Office. Together, we chose two highly-visited diseases, Zika and the Flu, to improve, along with several frequently-visited travel and immunization tasks. 

We started with a Discovery process to understand user needs based on previous studies, website traffic patterns, search patterns, a literature search on vaccine hesitancy and evidence from phone and support requests. A highlight was that the majority of Canadians visiting the pages were doing so on their smartphones - checking whether they had the cold or the flu, when they needed vaccinations, or which vaccinations they would need for a specific country.  

From these discovery insights, the team generated a set of Jobs to be Done (When I..., I want to ..., so I can ..) statements. Some examples include:

* When it's flu season, I want to know	if/where the flu shot is available, so I can	go and get it
* When I am worried about immunizing my child, I want to	know if the vaccine is safe, so I can	understand the risks
* When I return from a tropical trip, I want to	know if I can be tested for Zika, so I can	decide if I should delay pregnancy

From the long list of Jobs to be Done, the team used a Design Sprint dot voting technique to narrow down to the top 11 statements. We crafted these into detailed task scenarios that could be presented to Canadians who had volunteered to help improve the Canada.ca website. 

## Establishing a Baseline 

From the participant volunteers, we recruited 16 employed parents of children under the age of 18, who were able to attend research sessions in Toronto and Ottawa with their smartphones. In their sessions, participants were asked to complete to complete the full set of 11 task scenarios on the Canada.ca website. If they had time, they repeated one task on the Ontario.ca site for comparison. The task scenarios were presented in random order, except for the first and last tasks. Some tasks began on the home page of Canada.ca while others began on the Zika, Flu and Immunization topic pages. The scenarios, a timer set to 5.5 minutes and the possible answers to the scenario were presented on a tablet beside the participant. The participant could refer to the tablet while they attempted the task, and then return to enter in their answer and proceed to the next. 
 
The two important measures for Optimization studies are:
* Findability success rate - whether people found the page designed as the target for that task, and 
* Task Completion success rate - whether people successfully selected the correct answer to the task scenario
* Time on task - this was measured if the task had at least a 75% task completion success rate

The overall findability rate was 66%, and the overall success rate was 54% across the 11 tasks across the 176 task trials. 

The team observed videos of the sessions together to understand how people had used the site to solve the tasks. With the addition of clickpath maps, we were able to observe and quantify behaviours and usability issues that caused task failures. For example, 4 people were unable to complete task 4 because they kept trying to find Bermuda on the list of countries. The heading "Countries with recent or ongoing risk of Zika virus infection" had scrolled off the top of the long phone page. 

## Redesign to improve task success

To solve the long list of issues they'd captured, the team created a working prototype for a new mobile-1st design on Github. Several workshops were held with program teams to work intensively to resolve issues that participants experienced on those pages. For example, the Zika team realized that participants hadn't absorbed the serious risks of pregnancy after exposure to Zika. The immunization team worked hard to integrate content to counter vaccine hesitancy. New home page designs for Canada.ca were created to expose the links to Health and Travel that people missed in the baseline tests.

## Measure success rates on redesigned prototype
A new group of 16 parent participants was recruited to complete the same 11 tasks, this time on the prototype. The results of the new round of testing met the 20% improvement targets for a Canada.ca optimization project.  The new simplified navigation, home page designs and grouping of tasks improved findability rates from 66% up to 90%. Once they'd found the right target page, people were able to more successfully find the answers in the cleaner answer-not-information designs. Overall task completion success rose from 54% to 84% points.   
 
 This chart shows the task completion success rates across the baseline and redesigned validation test on the prototype for the 32 participants:

 ## Key drivers of success 
 The team derived this set of 6 design principles that appeared to have the most impact on improving success rates: 
 
* Design for mobile first - less prose, more space and interaction

* Group tasks and sub-tasks together to improve findability - reduce layers

* Design content to flow from specific to general -  with Calls to Action

* Lose the paper mentality - bring content into HTML out of PDF & posters

* Bring top tasks up  - don’t dilute with tiny tasks 

* Show Answers not information - surface and craft answers for top tasks
