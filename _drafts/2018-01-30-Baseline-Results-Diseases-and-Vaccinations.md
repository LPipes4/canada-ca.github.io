This article is an excerpt of the evidence and learning from the Diseases and Immuniazations top task optimization project. The project looks at issues across two important diseases - Zika and the Flu and for important travel and immunization tasks for Canadians. The entire team participated in the Discovery process to understand Canadian's needs for these tasks based on their mandate, website traffic patterns and evidence from phone and support requests. We quickly realized that most of the people visiting the pages were doing so on their smartphones - checking whether they had the cold or the flu, or which vaccinations they would need for a specific country.  From this evidence, we generated the set of tasks to measure and improve, by framing them as Jobs to be Done (When I..., I want to ..., so I can ..). Some examples include:

* When it's flu season, I want to know	if/where the flu shot is available, so I can	go and get it
* When I am worried about immunizing my child, I want to	know if the vaccine is safe, so I can	understand the risks
* When I return from a tropical trip, I want to	know if I can be tested for Zika, so I can	decide if I should delay pregnancy

These needs were then crafted into tasks that could be presented to Canadians who had volunteered to help improve the Canada.ca website via an invitation posted on the site. For this project, we selected people with children who were able to attend sessions in Toronto and Ottawa with their smartphones.

## Establishing a Baseline 

To find out how sucessful people were at finding the correct information and being able to complete their task we ran a usability (UX) test in which a set of participants to complete a series of tasks. The test looked at three main things (1) Was the participant able to find the correct information, (2) Was the participant able to successfully complete their task, (3) What path did they follow in their attempt to find the correct information.

The participants were asked to complete 11 tasks. Each task had to be completed within five minutes and the participant had to record their answer to the task. 


<p><br>
<ul>
<li> Q1.
This year's flu season could be worse than usual. Find the government’s advice on the most important way to avoid getting the flu. </li>
<br>
<li> Q2.
Your friend put up a post urging her friends not to vaccinate their kids because of the risk of autism. Find some answers that would make you feel ready to discuss it with her. </li>
<br>
<li> Q3. You got a few mosquito bites on your honeymoon down south but you feel fine. Before getting pregnant, you want to make sure you don’t have Zika. Is there a test that can tell if you're infected? </li>
<br>
<li> Q4. You plan to start a family soon, but want a sunny vacation first. Which of the countries below should you avoid because of the risk of Zika? </li>
<br>
<li> Q5. Your baby was born on the first of this month. At what age is the first set of vaccinations recommended? </li>
<br>
<li> Q6. It is flu season and a family member is pregnant. Find out whether or not she should get a flu shot while pregnant. </li> 
<br>
<li> Q7. You don't want to miss work tomorrow but should stay away if you have the flu. Yesterday, all of the symptoms below hit - find out which ones are the signal that it's the flu. </li>
<br>
<li> Q8. Find out whether the number of cases of flu last week were higher or lower than usual, to help you decide if you should get a flu shot now or wait. </li>
<br>
 <li> Q9. You think you heard something on the news about people being sick in Italy. Is there a particular concern you should be aware of before you go with your baby? </li>
<br>
<li> Q10. You are planning a trip to Mexico. Which specific vaccinations are recommended before you go? </li>
<br>
<li> Q11. The weekly flu report says most cases are an H3N2 flu. Find out if that particular flu is in this year's vaccine in Canada to help persuade your partner to get a flu shot.</li>
</ul>

<h3> Issues and Behaviours </h3>
<br>

<h4> Mobile users skim </h4>
<p> Participants were observed skimming through the content. As titles and headings scroll off phones faster, people couldn’t tell what they were looking at. This skimming behaviour was further evidenced by the amount of searches conducted after clicking on a few links and scrolling through some of the content (all tasks except 7).</p>

<h4> Complex navigation </h4>
<p> Top level navigation and overlapping topics caused failures. Finding the appropriate resources to complete tasks required a long and in some cases complex navigation.For example,tasks 4 and 5, starting at the Zika page, illustrated how complex navigation can be. Paths for these tasks include paths of up to 8 clicks on links.</p> 

<h4> Too many layers and headings </h4>
<p> Content does not provide answers up front and instead requires reading and coming to a conclusion on your own. Participants were observed reading multiple resources and concluding wrong answers.People failed at tasks because they were lost in posters & awareness resources (usually PDF, had to pinch and zoom on phones). </p>

<h4> Too much information </h4>
<p> Many pages and resources in the website contain more information than necessary. People had a hard time finding the right answer for tasks - they tended to scan the headings instead of the text where answers were buried, end up in the health professionals content like the Canadian Immunization Guide and missed answers under vague headings. Particpant frustration with the large amount of information they were being given was evidenced by the amount of searches done by participants overall (45% of all cases [tasks x participants]). Participants were also using the “find in page” functionalities on mobile and desktop to skip content on a page and go to the keywords they were looking for.</p>

## Driving Success - lessons learned

<p>
 
* Design for mobile first - less prose, more space and interaction

* Group tasks and sub-tasks together to improve findability

* Design content to flow from specific to general -  with Calls to Action

* Lose the paper mentality - bring content into html out of PDF & posters

* Bring top tasks up  - don’t dilute with tiny tasks 

* Show Answers not information - surface and craft answers for top tasks
