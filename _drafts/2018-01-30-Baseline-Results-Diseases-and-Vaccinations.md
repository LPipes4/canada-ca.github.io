It can be hard to keep track of all of the digital content an institution produces. Managing by tasks is a way to focus attention on what's most important - how people use that content. This article looks at a sample of baseline testing results from a recent usability (UX) test of several top task for Health Canada and Public Health Agency of Canada.


## What we mean by a task
 
A task is basically what someone wants to do. For example, some typical tasks might be: 

* renew my passport
* get the flu shot
* get insurance for my crops


This doesn't mean that we're creating new policies or services, but we're shifting the focus from how the organization thinks about their service (what we're doing and how we're doing it) to how the visitor consumes it (ensuring they can actually apply, understand the guidance to comply or make safe or healthy decisions, which in turn contribute to policy outcomes and change for Canadians).

That doesn't guarantee success of course. But it puts you in the right position to manage content in a way that focuses on the people who use it.

## Baseline Test Results - How successful were people at completing their tasks?

To find out how sucessful people were at finding the correct information and being able to complete their task we ran a usability test that asked the participants to complete a series of tasks. The test looked at three main things (1) Was the participant able to find the correct information, (2) Was the participant able to successfully able to complete their task, (3) What path did they follow in their attempt to find the correct information
The participants were asked to complete 11 tasks. Each task had to be completed within five minutes and the participant had to record their answer to the task. 



Q1.
This year's flu season could be worse than usual. Find the government’s advice on the most important way to avoid getting the flu.



Q2.
Your friend put up a post urging her friends not to vaccinate their kids
because of the risk of autism. Find some answers that would make you feel ready
to discuss it with her. 







## Writing the task at the right level

One of the hard things about writing tasks is putting them at a level that's useful. And this is really the deciding factor in what level you should situate your tasks at. Is it useful? 

As an example, suppose you're listing the tasks for your organization as a whole. Depending on the breadth of the mandate of the organization, you might need to go a little bit broader in your task descriptions. For example, an organization like the Parole Board of Canada has very discrete offerings to the public:
