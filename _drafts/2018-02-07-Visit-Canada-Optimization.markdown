Canada is a great big, beautiful country with lots to see and do. In 2017, Canada's 150th year of Confederation, we broke had approximately 20.8 million visitors, breaking our previous record.

It's no surprise then that two of the top five most popular services on Canada.ca are "Get a visitor visa" and "Get an electronic travel authorization (eTA)". Both of these travel documents are issued by Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC). 

Knowing which document you need to apply for, if any, isn’t always clear. Many people were having a hard time determining which one they needed, and some people were even stopped at the Canadian border because they had for the wrong document.

In January 2017, the IRCC Web team made it a priority to fix this task before a change to the eTA requirements came into effect in May which would have added to the confusion. To help out, the Digital Transformation Office worked with IRCC to improve people’s experience in figuring out what documents they need when visiting Canada. Here’s how this optimization project turned out. 

<h3>Issues</h3>
There was a lot of work done to explore the issues for these tasks including web reports, call centre reports, feedback from embassies, and of course testing. In a later post, we will discuss all the usability testing done for this project (it was a lot). For now, please accept that we ran hundreds of people through these tasks to find out how and why they were struggling. Here were some of the most prominent and recurrent issues we found.

This is what the page looked like when we started. Notice the text at the top of the page with links for Exceptions, dual citizens, and Canadian permanent residents. Testing showed that people weren't able to consistently see these links and would go straight to the drop-down list. 
<div itemprop="text" class="" data="type-text">
      <div class="img-responsive center-block col-md-6">
          <span class=""><img src="../images/VisaETA-before.jpg" alt="Image-showing-what-the-visa-page-looked-like-before-optimization" border="5">
 </span>
 </div>


<ul>
<li>the wizard that guides people through the task works better than the block of text</li>
<li>new pages were created for groups that were not represented (refugees and former permanent residents)</li>
<li>page navigation was simplified (left nav elements removed) to reduce cognitive load</li>
<li>the number of links on the Visit Canada topic page was reduced from 9 to 5 to streamline the target path</li>
<li>a crosslink to the Visit Canada topic page was added to the Travel theme menu based on user evidence</li>
</ul>


[before and after pictures] 
Due to this project, people who want to visit Canada, particularly those that do not speak English or French, can spend less time worrying about travel documents, and more time enjoying their visit to our country.
