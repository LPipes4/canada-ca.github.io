Canada is a great big, beautiful country with lots to see and do. It's no surprise we get a ton of tourists every year, over 18 million in 2015 according to StatsCan. 
Did you know that the second and fifth most popular services on Canada.ca are "Get a visitor visa" and "Get an electronic travel authorization (eTA)"? 
* [How we're optimizing Canada.ca top tasks](https://canada-ca.github.io/pages/top-task-list-canada-ca.html)

If you have never heard of an eTA before, you are not alone. It is not umcommon for countries to require foreigners to get a government-issued travel visa to visit. In Canada we have two types of these travel documents; travel visas and electronic travel authorizarions (eTA). Both of these travel documents are issued by Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), which is part of the Government of Canada. 

Knowing which document you need to apply for, if any, isnâ€™t always clear. Many people were having a hard time determining which one they should apply for, and some people were even stopped at the Canadian border because they had for the wrong document.

Last January the IRCC Web team made it a priority to fix this problem before a change to the eTA requirements came into effect which would have added to the confusion. The TBS Digital Transformation Office offered to help out. 

Some day soon, we will write a whole article on the different methods of usability testing we employed to study this issue. For now, just accept that we ran lots of people through these tasks to find out where and how they were struggling. Here are some of the most prominent issues we uncovered, along with the what we did to address them.

<li>the wizard that guides people through the task works better than the block of text</li>
<li>new pages were created for groups that were not represented (refugees and former permanent residents)</li>
<li>page navigation was simplified (left nav elements removed) to reduce cognitive load</li>
<li>the number of links on the Visit Canada topic page was reduced from 9 to 5 to streamline the target path</li>
<li>a crosslink to the Visit Canada topic page was added to the Travel theme menu based on user evidence</li>
</ul>

Due to this project, people who want to visit Canada, particularly those that do not speak English or French, can spend less time worrying about travel documents, and more time enjoying their visit to our country.
