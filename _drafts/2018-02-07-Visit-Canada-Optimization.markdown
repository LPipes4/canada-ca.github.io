When you think of Canada.ca you think of Government services directed at Canadians.

If you have never heard of an eTA before, you are not alone. Lots of places require foreigners to have some kind of government-issued travel visa to visit. In Canada we have two types of these travel documents; travel visas and an electronis travel authorizarions (eTA). Both of these travel documents are issued by Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), which is part of the Government of Canada.

**the wizard that guides people through the task works better than the block of text

**new pages were created for groups that were not represented (refugees and former permanent residents)

**page navigation was simplified (left nav elements removed) to reduce cognitive load

**the number of links on the Visit Canada topic page was reduced from 9 to 5 to streamline the target path

**a crosslink to the Visit Canada topic page was added to the Travel theme menu based on user evidence

Due to this project, people who want to visit Canada, particularly those that do not speak English or French, can spend less time worrying about travel documents, and more time enjoying their visit to our country.
