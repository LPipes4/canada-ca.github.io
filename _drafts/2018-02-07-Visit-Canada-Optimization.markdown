When you think of Canada.ca you think of Government services directed at Canadians. However, did you know that the second and fifth most popular services on Canada.ca are "Get a visitor visa" and "Get an electronic travel authorization (eTA)"
* [Top tasks for Canada.ca](https://canada-ca.github.io/pages/top-task-list-canada-ca.html)

If you have never heard of an eTA before, you are not alone. Many countries require people to have a government issued travel visa to visit their country. In Canada, we have two types of these travel documents; a travel visa and an eTA. Both of these travel documents are issued by Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), which is part of the Government of Canada. 

Knowing which document you need to apply for, if any, isn’t always clear. Many people were having a hard time determining which one they should apply for, and some people were even stopped at the Canadian border because they had for the wrong document.

We at the TBS Digital Transformation Office partnered up with the IRCC Web team to improve this experience for people trying to visit Canada. 

Early on, we faced a dilemma on how to conduct user testing for this project. Almost all of the people applying for these documents live in other countries, and many do not speak English or French. Therefore it would make sense to test with people from other countries, but to do so would require significantly more time and resources than we could afford. 

To address this situation, we decided to use four different methods of usability testing to make sure we learned everything we needed to about the content in a cost and time-effective way, while ensuring the task still worked with the target audience. The testing methods used in this project were as follows:

##1.	Moderated testing with Canadians

This is the method we are used to using on optimization projects. Facilitators sit down with actual people and watch them try to complete the tasks. The facilitators take careful notes on how users behave, and these insights are used to inform how to ultimately improve the content. We tested Canadian citizens to learn where people struggled when trying to complete the tasks. 

##2.	Unmoderated testing with people from other countries

##3.	“Café” or “Street” testing with Canadians

##4.	Survey testing with Canadians and foreign nationals


From this experience our team learned that the most effective testing methods were, surprisingly not the ones that were done solely online (unmoderated and survey testing), they were the ones that were done face-to-face with real people (moderated and café testing). 
From these effective testing methods, we found that a question and answer style web layout (or wizard) worked far better than the previous layout of big blocks of text.

Due to this project, people who want to visit Canada, particularly those that do not speak English or French, can spend less time worrying about travel documents, and more time enjoying their visit to our country.
