When you think of Canada.ca you think of Government services directed at Canadians. However, did you know that one of the most popular services on Canada.ca is…
Apply for a visa / electronic travel authorization (eTA) ? – hyperlink to TT list

If you have never heard of an eTA before, you are not alone. Many countries require people to have a government issued travel visa to visit their country, but in Canada, we require one of two. The first being a standard travel visa and the second being an eTA. Both of these travel documents are issued by Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), which is part of the Government of Canada. 

Knowing which document you need to apply for isn’t always clear. While getting an eTA is cheaper and faster than a visa, we found that people were having a hard time distinguishing which one they should apply for. Some even had issues entering Canada, simply because they had applied for the wrong document. 

We at the TBS Digital Transformation Office sought to improve this experience for people trying to visit Canada by working with IRCC to optimize this process. 

While Canada.ca is authored in Canada’s official language, English and French, many of the people applying for these documents may not speak these languages. So the project team faced a dilemma early on; do we test with Canadians speaking English and French or do we test with people from other countries using their own languages?
Intuitively, it seems best to test with people from other countries since they are the ones trying to accomplish this task, but doing so requires significantly more resources and would take much longer. 
Given the situation, we decided to use four different usability testing methods to answer the eTA vs visa question. The testing methods used in this project were as follows:

1.	Moderated testing with Canadians
Sitting down with actual people 

2.	Unmoderated testing with foreign nationals

3.	“Café” or “Street” testing with Canadians

4.	Survey testing with Canadians and foreign nationals


From this experience our team learned that the most effective testing methods were, surprisingly not the ones that were done solely online (unmoderated and survey testing), they were the ones that were done face-to-face with real people (moderated and café testing). 
From these effective testing methods, we found that a question and answer style web layout (or wizard) worked far better than the previous layout of big blocks of text.

Due to this project, people who want to visit Canada, particularly those that do not speak English or French, can spend less time worrying about travel documents, and more time enjoying their visit to our country.
