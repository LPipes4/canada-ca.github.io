The Digital Transformation Office is currently engaged in an optimization project with the Canada Revenue Agency. This time, we are looking at tasks related to filing payroll and GST/HST. 

For more general information about how we optimize tasks on Canada.ca see the following:
* [How we're optimizing Canada.ca top tasks](https://canada-ca.github.io/category/2017/12/12/optimization-overview.html)

## Baseline Test Results - What tasks did we test?

For this project, we wanted to focus in on issues that people were actually facing. To do this, we invited agents from CRA's call centres to help craft the task scenarios. Some of these people actually answer phones when people call CRA with their questions. 

Test participants were asked to complete all 10 tasks, with 5 minutes per task. The questions were as follows, although the order changed for each participant. 
<p>
<ul>      
<li> T1 (Pay deductions by Interac) Can you pay your company's payroll CPP and EI deductions to CRA using Interac?</li>
<li> T2 (GST: Invoice date) You issued an invoice for services, with GST included, the day before you filed your return. Can you wait until the invoice is paid before sending in your payment?</li>
<li> T3 (Correcting payroll remittance) You accidentally made an error when you submitted your last payroll return. You under-paid your source deductions by $350. Will you be fined?</li>
<li> T4 (GST: Place of supply) If your Ontario company sells and ships a taxable product to a customer in Alberta, do you charge them GST, PST or both (i.e. HST)?</li>
<li> T5 (Confirm payroll received) You mailed a cheque to pay your company’s payroll deductions. How would you confirm that the CRA received it?</li>
<li> T6 (GST - instalments?) You registered for GST for the first time in on August 31, and will file your return annually. Your fiscal year ended October 31. In that time, your net tax was $2,500. Will you need to pay your GST in instalments for the next fiscal year?</li>
<li> T7 (When to remit payroll) A business collects taxes from its employees’ pay. It sends the taxes it has collected to the government 4 times a year. When must it send the next payment by?</li>
<li> T8 (Max CPP deductions) In 2018, what will be the maximum amount of CPP contributions for one employee for the whole year?</li>
<li> T9 (GST - remit date (first-time)) You have recently registered for a GST account and have been collecting GST. How would you find out when you have to pay it?</li>
<li> T10 (Nil payroll remittance) Your business operates seasonally, so you don't pay employees during the winter. Do you need to let CRA know this?</li>
</ul>

## Baseline Test Results - How successful were people at completing their tasks?
The following chart compares the baseline test scores for findability with the task completion score for all ten questions posed to participants. The bars with a check mark represent task success (Was the participant able to successfully complete the task?) and the bars with a magnifying glass represent task findability (was the participant able to get to the page with the answer on it?).

## Common issues uncovered in testing

Many people got lost on long pages of text. They may be on the correct page, but if their answer is too obscured to be found, the task is still not successful.

</p>

<div itemprop="text" class="" data="type-text">
      <div class="img-responsive left-block col-md-6">
          <span class=""><img src="../images/taxes-impots/TF-slide1.JPG" alt="Menu-too-hard-to-find" style="floating:left">
<span>
<br>
      Sometimes people would be have to look throughlong lists of links to find the next step. In many cases, they were not able to find the right link.
      
<div itemprop="text" class="" data="type-text">
      <div class="img-responsive left-block col-md-6">
          <span class=""><img src="../images/taxes-impots/TF-slide2.JPG" alt="Menu-too-hard-to-find" style="floating:left">
<br>
      Another problem that came up frequently involved pages that seemed like they should have the right answer on it but didn't. In user centered design terms, the "scent of information" was leading people downt the wrong path.

Recommendation: make the menu items as visible in the mobile view as they are in the desktop view.
