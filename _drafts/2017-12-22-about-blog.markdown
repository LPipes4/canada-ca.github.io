<!-- Why we do the blog here:

* We use GitHub all the time anyway
* GitHub pages is easy if you're used to GitHub
* Built-in version control is good
* AEM can't do any blog-like things so that wasn't an option
* We want to be able to make changes rapidly and avoid a long publication schedule
* We want our work to be in the open

-->


Working in the open is one of the proposed [Digital principles](http://open.canada.ca/en/blog/digital-principles) for the Government of Canada, and it's something we believe in strongly at the Digital Transformation Office. That's why we've been working to describe what we're doing on this blog. But why is our blog here?

## 1. GitHub is already a key part of our workflow

The Government of Canada has been using GitHub for years, and it was a natural choice for hosting prototypes we develop as part of our [optimization projects](https://canada-ca.github.io/category/2017/12/12/optimization-overview.html). With GitHub pages, we have simple, reliable webhosting allowing for multiple authors and built-in version control. 

GitHub has a lot of benefits that we're happy to take advantage of. 

## 2. We want speed and flexibility
